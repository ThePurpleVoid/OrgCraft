# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First public version, extracted from a production agent team and generalised.

- 48 role briefs across engineering, quality, product and design, go-to-market, customer and corporate lanes.
- Shared protocols: one door, dilution rule, fast and full lanes, HANDOFF, BUG, SIGNOFF and BLOCKED, ownership, memory files, dormant roles.
- `agent-team` CLI (`init`, `sync`, `check`, `roles`), run with npx: projects keep only a `.agent-team/` overlay (role extensions, new roles, include/exclude, gates and pools) and generate the rest from a pinned kit version.
- `minimal`, `engineering` and `company` presets.
- Example overlay for native Android and iOS apps.
- Scripts: `team-status.sh`, `team-board.sh`, `merge-gate.sh` (config-driven gates), `with-lock.sh` (config-driven pools), `janitor.sh`.
- Tools: `roster.mjs` (check and print the org) and `export-subagents.mjs` (briefs to Claude Code subagents).
- Optional hosted board on Supabase, readable from a website with `TEAM_DASHBOARD_ORIGINS`.
- Live web dashboard (`agent-team dashboard`, `scripts/agent-team/dashboard.mjs`): the org chart and hand-off flow drawn from the briefs, each role lit by its thread's last report, a panel per role, the feed and a phone layout. Runs locally with instant updates from the event log, takes reports from other machines on `POST /api/report`, has a `--demo` mode, and exports as static files or mounts into your own site (`AgentTeamDashboard.mount`) to read a hosted board.
- `team-status.sh` gives every report an id and posts to `TEAM_REPORT_URL` with or without a token.
- The org tree in the project instructions is generated from the installed roles.
- The role template is generated as `docs/team/role-template.md`, so tools that read every file in `docs/team/roles/` see only roles.
- Fixed: generated Node tools keep their `#!` line first, so `node scripts/agent-team/roster.mjs` runs.
- Releases: every new version in `package.json` on main is tagged and released automatically.
